# Resume Website (HTML & CSS)

This project was created as an assignment for my Web Technology course in the BCA program. The task was to build a personal CV using HTML and CSS and work toward making it responsive.

## About the Project
- The layout is based on an online template because I’m still improving my design skills.
- The current personal information is not fully accurate yet.
- The site is not responsive at the moment; I will update it as I learn more.
- This is my first web project, so expect updates and refinements over time.

## Usage
You are free to use this code and modify it to create your own resume.
